# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

## What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical harassment of a sexual nature in the workplace.

There are two types of sexual harassment:

* ### Quid pro quo

    Quid pro quo harassment occurs when a supervisor's request for sexual favors or other sexual conduct results in a tangible job action. Like, I'll give you the promotion if you sleep with me or I'll fire you unless you go out with me.

* ### Hostile work environment

    A hostile work environment occurs when an employee is subjected to unwelcome physical or verbal conduct of a sexual nature that is so severe or pervasive as to alter the employee's working conditions.

### Any of the following actions can be sexual harassment if they happen often enough to make an employee uncomfortable, or distracted enough to interfere with their work

* making sexual jokes
* repeated compliments of an employee's appearance
* commenting on the attractiveness of others in front of an employee
* discussing one's sex life in front of an employee
* circulating nude photos or photos of women in bikinis or shirtless men in the workplace
* sending sexually suggestive text messages or emails
* spreading sexual rumors about an employee.

## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

If I would face or witness any sexual harassment incident repeatedly, firstly I would warn the person to don't do this. If the person didn't back off, I will talk with the supervisor. If the supervisior is itself assaulter then I would talk with the assaulter supervisior.

## How to behave appropriately?

* Have fun with colleagues but do not make any sexual jokes. Your jokes maybe don't affect your friend but it can make uncomfortable or unwelcoming many others.
* Be humble and respectful to others, everyone has a different mindset.
* Do not share any sexual pictures or text messages.
* Do not come office in shorts.
