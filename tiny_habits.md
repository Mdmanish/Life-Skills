# Tiny Habits

## 1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg

### Your takeaways from the video (Minimum 5 points)

* To change behavior in long term, there are two ways we can get it done:

    1. We can change our environment/ social environment

    2. Make behavior very tiny and increase it day by day.

* Relying primarily on motivation to change behavior in long term is a losing strategy. Motivation applies only to temporary behavior change.

* After doing tiny behavior and wanting to do it again in the future or maybe expand, we should celebrate the victory immediately.

* Habits can change our health.

* By Creating tiny habits you can change your behavior and life forever.

* three things have to happen at the same moment to cause a behavior (B = mat):

    1. There has to be some level of Motivation

    2. You have to Ability to do it

    3. There has to be a Trigger means to poll the action.

* Whatever we want to change in our life we need to break it out into tiny behaviors and put them in the right spot.

## 2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message

### Your takeaways from the video in as much detail as possible

BJ Fogg has discovered a universal formula of human behavior which is B = MAP (Behaviour = Motivation Ability Prompt). This formula says that if you trying to develop a new habit, you will perform the habit if your motivation matches the ability required to read the moment you receive a prompt to read.

Fogg gives three Tiny Habits Method

* Shrink the Behaviour

Fogg says that if a task is hard, then you need a high level of motivation to complete the task. If a task is easy you only need a little motivation to complete task. He suggests that by shrinking every new habit to the tiniest possible version you don't need to rely on motivation. You can find the tiniest
a version of your desired habit by either reducing the quantity or doing just the first step.

Your ultimate goal is to find a behavior that you can easily do in thirty seconds or less.

* Identify an Action Prompt

There are three types of habit prompts

1. External Prompts

2. Internal Prompts

3. Action Prompts

External and internal prompts are distracting and de‐motivating. If you use external Prompts like alarms to prompt your new habit, you’ll need to stop what you’re doing and pivot to your new habit. But if you use an action prompt, momentum will carry you from one behavior to the next, and you’ll need less motivation to start your new habit. There are many actions prompts you can use to perform the thirty-second habit. Like one breath meditation after every stress.

* Grow Your Behavior with Some Shine

We feel shine when we understood a concept clearly. We feel shone when we achieve something very good.

To sustain and grow our habit we must generate the feeling of shine after we execute our tiny habit. Learning to celebrate tiny wins is the most critical component of habit development so we should feel pride and success after doing one tiny habit.

When we give ourselves a steady dose of shine after doing the tiniest version of a habit, our motivation will steadily grow. When our motivation increases, we move higher up the action line and can tackle harder habits. Soon our one-breath meditation turns into a 5-minute meditation and eventually a 60‐minute meditation we look forward to every day.

### How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier?

By doing the following thing I can use the Fogg method to make new habits easier.

* Make the goal into tiny habits.

* Celebrate the successful completion of every small task.

* After every stress or after using social media I will do one‐breath‐meditation.

### Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?

When we feel shine or celebrate something, even if it’s tiny, our confidence grows quickly, and our motivation increases to do that habit again and perform related behaviors.

## 3. 1% Better Every Day Video

### Your takeaways from the video (Minimum 5 points) 2

* By doing small improvements we can achieve anything.

* To do something big we need to follow a schedule regularly. By following the schedule we can achieve our target.

* Environment often influences people. If we present something in front of people, people will do that. People do things simply because they have the option to do them. So design an environment so that your good behavior becomes easier and bad behavior harder.

* I will keep my necessary things like that so it becomes easy to access and use them.

* If we want to form new habits, we should make them obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying.

* We give our goals a time and place.

## 4. Book Summary of Atomic Habits

### Write about the book's perspective on habit formation from the lens of Identity, processes, and outcomes.

`Atomic habits may be individually small, but collectively and given time they could hold remarkable power to bring remarkable change to our lives.`

There are three layers of behavior change:

* Identity
* Process
* Outcomes

Outcomes are about what we get. Processes are about what we do. Identity is about what we believe.

Most of us work from outcome to identity rather than identity to the outcome. Make habits part of our identity. When solving a problem based on outcomes we only solve them temporarily. To solve the problem in long term we should change our identity.

We can achieve major transformations, just by following small daily routines and by doing the same task multiple times. The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes a part of our identity.

To change our behavior for good, we need to start believing new things about ourselves. we need to build identity-based habits and they should not be outcome centric.

### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a good habit easier.

To make a good habit easier we need to make it:

1. Obvious
2. Attractive
3. Easy
4. Satisfying

To make good habits easier we have to put fewer steps between us and good behaviors.

Make habits attractive.

Making it easy means reducing friction and priming our environment for the habits that we would like to develop. Reducing the friction makes it far more likely to do the thing.

We should try to attach some form of immediate gratification so that we can make habit immediately satisfying.

### Write about the book's perspective on making a bad habit more difficult?

To make a bad habit diificult we need to make it:

1. Invisible
2. Eughly
3. Hard
4. Unsatisfying

Explanation is just opposite of making goob habit easier.

## 5. Reflection

### Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

* Follow a schedule on which I will do programming.
* At least one problem I will solve for now.
* Maintain the streak to get motivated and to solve the problem next day.
* Bookmark the coding website to make it easy access.

### Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
