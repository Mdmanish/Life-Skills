# Learning Process

## How to learn fast

### What is the Feynman Technique?

For learning effectively Scientist Richard P. Feynman has given a technique which is called as Feynman Technique.
This technique describes four points:

* Whichever concept you have read, write down that concept's name on a plane paper.
* Explain the concept in your language in the paper.
* Whenever you get stuck during explaining yourself, read about that point again.
* And take the challenge yourself to read understand and explain the difficult terms.

Whatever concept you learn you should be able to explain that concept to someone else who doesn't know even the basics of that concept. If you can explain briefly the concept to someone else, then it means you learned effectively.

### What are the different ways to implement this technique in your learning process?

Other than Feynman Technique there are few different ways to implement the techniques in my learning process.

* After learning the concept, I writes the codes and practece some similar problems as well as differnt types of problem.
* Makes notes on that concept during learning itself.
* Learning the same concept 3-4 times.

## Learning How to Learn TED talk by Barbara Oakley

Barbara Oakley talks about herself and tells how she was not interested in learning mathematics. To overcome the fear of learning mathematics she followed some techniques that were given by some great people. She implements those different techniques to change her brain to grasp more and more knowledge and understand mathematics and other concepts as well. She talks about those great techniques in the TEDx talk.

Promodoro technique: This technique says that for doing something remove all disturbing gadgets and work continuously for 25 min without any disturbance and then take a break for fun and relaxation.

She also talks about those students who have less memory capacity to remember. She said that those students are more creative.

Whenever you read the same concept again, before reading the same concept again once recall the concept. By doing this you will remember for a long time and it will enhance your understanding of the concept.

She said whatever you learn take a test on yourself and learn the same concept again and again until it doesn't flow in your mind like a song flows.

In conclusion combined with practice and repetition in a variety of circumstances can you truly gain mastery over what you learning.

### What are some of the steps that you can take to improve your learning process?

Following steps I will take to improve my learning process:

* During revision I will first recall the concepts.
* I will explain to anyone or myself what I learned.

## Learn Anything in 20 hours

### Your key takeaways from the video? Paraphrase your understanding.

What I learned from the videos is that learning new skills in starting few days takes more time to understand things and by studying day by day understanding the concept of that topic becomes easier. And after investing 20hrs. in learning the same skill you will able to know all of the important topics. And to become a master of that skill takes more time nearly 1000hrs. which is almost equal to the 5 years of office working time.

To have a good understanding of the new skill you have to give minimum 20hrs by following some techniques:

* Before starting to learn a new skill, firstly decide what you want to able to do using this skill.
* Take 3-4 resources to self-correct during learning.
* Remove practice barriers.
* Practice at least 20hrs.

The major barrier to skill acquisition isn't intellectual it's emotional. So don't feel stupid by comparing others, just give 20hrs effectively you will catch the skill.

### What are some of the steps that you can while approaching a new topic?

Following steps I took while approaching a new topic:

* I always used to ask what will be the final result of studying this skill.
* How this skill will be useful in my life.
* I see different-different resources and read a topic from every resource. From which resource I am understanding better I take that as the final resource to complete the topic.
* I remove all practice barriers.
* I study consistently to complete the topic.
* I always practice before watching or reading the concept.
