Social media sites are a business, in which they are taking our every movements records and sells it to another to make money from it. These social medai wants to addict users with their social sites so that we user can spend more of our time with those sites and by collecting our every moments record they will make money. They are even hires attention engineers so that user can spend more time with their soctial sites. This is the desired use case of these social media sites.
Now a days we most are thinks that if I will not be in social media then people will not know that who I am, people will not able to find me, opportuniteis will not come my way and I will effictively disapper from the world. That's not the truth. If you can write an elegant algorithm, if you can wirte legal brief that can change a case, if you can write thousand words of prose that's going to fixate a reader right to the end, if you can apply statistics on an ambigous data and pull out insights that could transfer a business stratefy, if you can do these types of activities which requires a deep work, people will find you.

If you will lose your ability to sustain concentration, you're going to become less and less relevant to this economy. There is also psychological harms that the more you use social medial, the more likely you are to going to feel lonely or isolated.
